# elphmod

This is a collection of Python modules to handle electron-phonon models:

* `el` - tight-binding models from Wannier90
* `ph` - mass-spring models from Quantum ESPRESSO
* `elph` - electron-phonon coupling from EPW
* `elel` - Coulomb interaction from VASP
* `MPI` - work distribution and shared memory
* `bravais` - lattices, symmetries, and interpolation
* `dispersion` - diagonalization on paths and meshes
* `dos` - 2D tetrahedron methods
* `diagrams` - susceptibilities, self-energies, etc.
* `occupations` - step and delta smearing functions
* `eliashberg` - parameters for McMillan's formula
* `plot` - BZ plots, color models, and fatbands
* `misc` - status bars etc.

## Installation

elphmod depends on MPI (with shared-memory support). Using APT, it can be
installed as follows:

    sudo apt install libopenmpi-dev

It also depends on the Python packages listed in the file "requirements.txt".
One way to install them is inside a virtual environment:

    python3 -m venv elphmod.venv
    source elphmod.venv/bin/activate
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt

## Documentation

All functions are documented directly in the source files using NumPy-style
docstrings. You can generate an automatic documentation in HTML format using
Sphinx:

    cd doc
    make html
    firefox html/index.html

Please also have a look at the examples:

    cd examples
    mpirun python3 electrons.py
    mpirun python3 phonons.py
