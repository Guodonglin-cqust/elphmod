Python modules for electron-phonon models


E x a m p l e

    $ cd examples
    $ mpirun -np 4 python -u example.py

will show you:

    (1) comparison with phonon dispersion from Quantum ESPRESSO's matdyn.x
    (2) ordered phonon bands along winding path through reciprocal unit cell
    (3) Fermi-surface average of electron-phonon interaction for each band
    (4) phonon density of states and shape of Eliashberg spectral function
