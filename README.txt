Some Python modules to handle force constants and electron-phonon interaction..

    $ mpirun -np 4 python example.py

will show you:

    (1) comparison with phonon dispersion from Quantum ESPRESSO's matdyn.x
    (2) ordered phonon bands along winding path through reciprocal unit cell
    (3) Fermi surface average of electron-phonon interaction for each band
    (4) phonon density of states and shape of Eliashberg spectral function
