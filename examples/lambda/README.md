# Electron-phonon coupling for superconductivity

This example will show you how to calculate the electron-phonon coupling needed
in Eliashberg theory of superconductivity. However, it is not finished yet.

To get the coupling from EPW, you need a modified version of Quantum ESPRESSO.
You can use the provided [patch](../../patches) to apply the required changes.
