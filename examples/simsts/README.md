# Simulated STS spectrum of graphene

This example will show how to simulate scanning-tunnelling spectra (i.e., the
density of states at a certain position above the sample) using a Hamiltonian
in the Wannier basis. So far, it only shows how to calculate the density of
states of the p-z bands of graphene.
